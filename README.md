# Knock-Detecting-Lock
Our project takes input frequency from user in form of knocks and saves it.
It compares the pattern of knocking whenever user tries to access it to the saved pattern of frequency.
So, to open the lock user must know the exact pattern of knocking. This makes it smart lock , which
gives limited chances to open the lock, and if user fails to do so, it does not give further chance to
open the lock and sets the security alarm.
We use sensor or mic to detect input frequency of knocking. The process is carried through Arduino
Uno controller. It has prestored pattern in its memory. Program is written in Arduino IDE. Gear
motor is used to control opening or closing of mechanical lock attached. LEDs are used as status
lights.

SECRET KNOCK DETECTING Lock using Arduino is a cutting-edge security system that combines advanced
audio analysis and self learning techniques to create a novel and robust access control mechanism. Traditional
locks are vulnerable to physical attacks, and electronic locks can be susceptible to hacking. This project
introduces a unique approach to lock security by analyzing the distinctive acoustic patterns generated by different
knocks.
The system utilizes an array of sensitive microphones to capture the acoustic signature of a knocking pattern.
These audio signals are then processed through signal processing algorithms to extract relevant frequency-based
features. Learning models are employed to classify and authenticate incoming knocks based on their unique
frequency profiles. The lock system is capable of adapting and learning from variations in knocking patterns over
time, enhancing its accuracy and resilience against false positives or negatives.
The Frequency-Based Knock Detecting Lock offers numerous advantages, including increased security, minimal
false alarm rates, and user-friendly operation. This project explores the technical challenges associated with
signal processing, machine learning model development, and real-time authentication, ultimately creating a
sophisticated lock system that can be integrated into various access control scenarios, such as homes, offices, and
secure facilities.
This innovative project demonstrates the potential of audio-based authentication systems, which can complement
or replace traditional locking mechanisms, making them more secure and tamper-resistant. The Frequency-Based
Knock Detecting Lock represents a significant advancement in the field of access control and stands as a
testament to the possibilities of using sound as a means of enhancing security and convenience
